## Usage

- Visiting `/` will show two options:
  - Create room and make you teacher (server chooses new room name)
  - Join room as student (server checks if room exists)
- Visiting `/room` will:
  - Create `room` if it doesn't exist and make you the teacher
  - Join `room` as a student if it exists
- Teacher client saves room secret as cookie
- A room has exactly one teacher, zero or more students
- A room is destroyed if it has no students or teachers
