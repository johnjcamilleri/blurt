## About

### Usage

- Visiting `/` will show two options:
  - Create room and make you the owner (server chooses new room name)
  - Join room as participant (server checks if room exists)
- Visiting `/room` will:
  - Create `room` if it doesn't exist and make you the owner
  - Join `room` as a participant if it exists
- Owner client saves room secret as cookie
- A room has exactly one owner, zero or more participants
- A room is destroyed if it has no participants or owner

### Features

- Responses are updated live in owner's view as participants type, sized according to frequency
- Minimal, projector-friendly UI (dark background, no borders, content at top)
- QR code for participants to scan
- Show/hide responses
- Pause/resume live updating
- Clear all responses
- Pick a random participant
- Modes
  - free-text (input field)
  - yes/no/maybe

### Intentionally missing features

- Pre-prepared content
- Users or registrations
- History or statistics
- Childish graphics or annoying animations
