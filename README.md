## Usage

- Visiting <blurt.lol> will show two options:
  - Create room (server chooses new name)
  - Join room (server checks if name exists before redirecting)
- Visiting <blurt.lol/room> will
  - Create `room` if it doesn't exist and make you the teacher
  - Join `room` as a student if it exists
- Teacher saves room secret as cookie
- A room has exactly one teacher
- A room is destroyed if is has no students or teachers

## Snippets

Fast-forward merge `dev` into `main` and push (from `dev`):

```sh
git fetch . dev:main && \
git push origin main
```

## TODO

- UI messages
- Clear in yes/no mode doesn't work reliably on mobile devices
