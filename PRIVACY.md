## Cookies

- When creating a room as an owner, a cookie is used to give you exclusive ownership.
  It contains the room name and a random secret, like this:

  ```plain
  Set-Cookie raspberry=jycx2ecka6k; Path=/
  ```

- Cookies are also used to display user interface messages, like this:

  ```plain
  Set-Cookie message=Room%20'raspberry'%20created; Path=/
  ```

- When accessing a room as a participant, no cookies are used.

## Server logs

All actions and user input is logged on the server.
Clients are identified by randomly generated web socket IDs, but no personally identifiable information is stored (not even IP address or browser info):
